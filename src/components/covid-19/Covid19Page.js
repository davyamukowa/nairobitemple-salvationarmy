            We are now meeting at our church building At Nairobi Central Temple in OTC  as a COVID safe venue.

            regular attenders are required to obtain a Sunday pass for each Sunday service they attend.
            Numbers are capped to safely allow extra visitors unfamiliar with our pass system.

            and there is no congregational singing or passing an offering plate.
