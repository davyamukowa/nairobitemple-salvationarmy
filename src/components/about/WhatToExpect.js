      <h2>Parking</h2>
      <p>There are parking spaces  in our  church building. Our greeters are happy to assist with the drop-off of anyone with physical limitations. Please do not hesitate to get their attention and ask for help.</p>

      <h2>Our Sweet Music </h2>
      <p>Music forms an integral part of Salvation Army worship and evangelism. Bands and songster brigades and Praise and Eorship Team are an important part of Nairobi Central life and public events with the brass band as the most recognised feature of Salvation Army music.</p>

      <h2>What to Do with Children</h2>
      <p>Infants through 3 year-olds can be taken to the Sunday School as soon as you like. Simply ask one of our Ushers to show you the way.
      Children aged 4 through 10 stay with their families in the worship service until time for the message (Sunday morning).
      At that time, it will be announced that children are dismissed to Children's Church.
      Your children can easily find their way by joining the stampede, but you are very welcome to accompany them to see where you will collect them after the service.</p>

      <h2>Our Worship Services</h2>
      <p>You will find that our worship services are designed to be friendly, edifying, Scripture-oriented, and Christ-honouring. We strive to do things well but not to be overly formal. Our worship-music style is a fairly conservative blend, making use of Psalms (Scripture songs), hymns (songs of praise to God & of doctrinal truth), and spiritual songs (songs of testimony/reflection of the Christian experience & expressions of personal faith, love, and hope) both old and new. We use a range of instruments from one service to another, including piano, electric keyboard, acoustic & bass guitars, and various orchestral instruments. Our blend varies from week to week, so it will take a few visits to get an accurate idea of what constitutes our "style."</p>
      <p>These meetings have a relaxed atmosphere, and can include hymn singing, Bible readings, testimonies (members of the congregation talking about their Christian experiences), and presentations by worship or drama groups. The hymns and songs may be accompanied by a traditional Salvation Army brass band or a more contemporary worship band with keyboard, guitars, drums and other instruments. The Songsters (choir) may provide a vocal lead or present a reflective musical item..</p>
